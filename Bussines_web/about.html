                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], the person behind 404 Found!. My journey into web design and development wasn't a straightforward one, but it was one I had to take. A few years ago, I was at a low point in my life. I had just lost my job due to unforeseen circumstances, and for the first time, I found myself unsure of what to do next. The world felt uncertain, and the future felt like a distant dream.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the struggle, I turned to what I loved: technology. I began learning about web development in my spare time, teaching myself through online tutorials, trial and error, and countless late nights. What started as a way to distract myself from the frustration of my job loss became a passion. I found joy in creating something from scratch, seeing it come to life on a screen, and knowing that I had the power to bring a vision to reality.</p>
                <p>Over time, I realized that web development was more than just a hobby—it was my calling. It wasn't easy to get started, but I took on small freelance projects, learning and growing with each one. Slowly, I built up enough confidence to leave the past behind and take the leap into running my own business. The decision wasn't easy, but I knew that if I wanted to have control over my future, I had to take that risk.</p>
                <p>Today, 404 Found! is my way of helping others who feel lost or overwhelmed. I know what it’s like to start from scratch and not have a clear path ahead. That’s why I approach every project with a personal touch—because I know how important it is to have someone who truly cares about your success. My mission is to provide small businesses and individuals with the tools to create a meaningful online presence, just like I had to do for myself.</p>
